# ungoogled-chromium

*Bringing back the "Don't" in "Don't be evil"*

**ungoogled-chromium is Google Chromium**, sans integration with Google. It also features some changes to enhance privacy, control, and transparency.

## Motivation and Description

A number of features or background services communicate with Google servers despite the absence of an associated Google account or compiled-in Google API keys. Furthermore, the normal build process for Chromium involves running Google's own high-level commands that invoke many scripts and utilities, some of which download and use pre-built binaries provided by Google. Even the final build output includes some pre-built binaries. Fortunately, the source code is available for everything.

ungoogled-chromium is a set of configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts. These components altogether strive to accomplish the following:
* Disable or remove offending services and features that communicate with Google or weaken privacy
* Strip binaries from the source tree, and use those provided by the system or build them from source
* Disable features that inhibit control and transparency, and add or modify features that promote them (these changes are minor and do not have significant impacts on the general user experience)

**ungoogled-chromium should not be considered a fork of Chromium**. The main reason for this is that a fork is associated with more significant deviations from the Chromium, such as branding, configuration formats, file locations, and other interface changes. ungoogled-chromium will not modify the Chromium browser outside of the project's goals.

Since these goals and requirements are not precise, unclear situations are discussed and decided on a case-by-case basis.

**ungoogled-chromium is looking for contributors**. See the [Contributing, Reporting, Contacting](#contributing-reporting-contacting) section for more information.

## Features

A number of ungoogled-chromium's changes are subtle and evolve over time. As a result, it is best to consult the source code for complete and up-to-date information.

ungoogled-chromium selectively borrows many of its features from the following:
* [Debian](//tracker.debian.org/pkg/chromium-browser)
* [Inox patchset](//github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset)
* [Iridium Browser](//iridiumbrowser.de/)

Most of the **additional** features are as follows:
* Replace many web domains in the source code with non-existent alternatives ending in `qjz9zk` (known as domain substitution; [see docs/design.md](docs/design.md#source-file-processors))
* Strip binaries from the source code (known as binary pruning; [see docs/design.md](docs/design.md#source-file-processors))
* Disable functionality specific to Google domains (e.g. Google Host Detector, Google URL Tracker, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Hotwording, etc.)
* Add Omnibox search provider "No Search" to allow disabling of searching
* Disable automatic formatting of URLs in Omnibox (e.g. stripping `http://`, hiding certain parameters)
* Added menu item under "More tools" to clear the HTTP authentication cache on-demand
* Add new command-line switches and `chrome://flags` entries:
    * `--disable-beforeunload` - (Not in `chrome://flags`) Disables JavaScript dialog boxes triggered by `beforeunload`
    * `--disable-search-engine-collection` - Disable automatic search engine scraping from webpages.
    * `--enable-stacked-tab-strip` and `--enable-tab-adjust-layout` - These flags adjust the tab strip behavior. `--enable-stacked-tab-strip` is also configurable in `chrome://flags` Please note that they are not well tested, so proceed with caution.
    * `--extension-mime-request-handling` - Change how extension MIME types (CRX and user scripts) are handled. Acceptable values are `download-as-regular-file` or `install-always`. Leave unset to use normal behavior. It is also configurable under `chrome://flags`
    * `--fingerprinting-client-rects-noise` - Implements fingerprinting deception of JS APIs `getClientRects()` and `getBoundingClientRect()` by scaling their output values with a random factor in the range -5% to 5%, which are recomputed for every document instantiation.
    * `--set-ipv6-probe-false` - (Not in `chrome://flags`) Forces the result of the browser's IPv6 probing (i.e. IPv6 connectivity test) to be unsuccessful. This causes IPv4 addresses to be prioritized over IPv6 addresses. Without this flag, the probing result is set to be successful, which causes IPv6 to be used over IPv4 when possible.
* Force all pop-ups into tabs
* Disable [Safe Browsing](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Safe_Browsing)
    * See the [FAQ](//ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki/faq#why-is-safe-browsing-disabled)
* Disable intranet redirect detector (extraneous DNS requests)
    * This breaks captive portal detection, but captive portals still work.
* Add more URL schemes allowed for saving
* (Iridium Browser feature change) Prevent URLs with the `trk:` scheme from connecting to the Internet
    * Also prevents any URLs with the top-level domain `qjz9zk` (as used in domain substitution) from attempting a connection.
* (Iridium and Inox feature change) Prevent pinging of IPv6 address when detecting the availability of IPv6. See the `--set-ipv6-probe-false` flag above to adjust the behavior instead.
* Support for building Linux packages for multiple distributions (work in progress)
* Windows support
    * Does not set the Zone Identifier on downloaded files

**NOTE: Although it is the top priority to eliminate bugs and privacy-invading code, there will be those that slip by due to the fast-paced growth and evolution of the Chromium project.**

### Supported platforms and distributions

Currently, only desktop platforms are supported. Functionality of specific desktop platforms may vary across different releases. For more details, see [Statuses in the Wiki](//ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki/statuses).

Other platforms are discussed and tracked in GitHub's Issue Tracker. Learn more about using the Issue Tracker under the section [Contributing, Reporting, Contacting](#contributing-reporting-contacting).

## Getting the source code

Users are encouraged to use [one of the tags](//github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/tags). The latest tag may not be the applicable for all platforms. To determine the tag to use, please see the [Status page in the Wiki](https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki/statuses).

Tags are versioned in the following format: `{chromium_version}-{release_revision}` where

* `chromium_version` is the version of Chromium used in `x.x.x.x` format, and
* `release_revision` is a number indicating the version of ungoogled-chromium for the corresponding Chromium version.

Not all tags are stable for all platforms. See the [Statuses in the Wiki](//ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki/statuses) to determine the tag to use.

### How to help

Anyone is free to help others in need of support in the Issue Tracker.

Issues marked with the `help wanted` tag are changes that needs discussion or assistance.

* If it requires new code, please read through the [Submitting changes](#submitting-changes) section below.
* If you want to work on an issue, please state your intent to do so first to let others know.

If there are fixes, tweaks, or additions you want to make, continue onto the following section.

### Submitting changes

Please submit all changes via Pull Requests.

Guidelines:

* You are welcome to submit minor changes, such as bug fixes, documentation fixes, and tweaks.
* If you want to submit a new feature, please read through the [Criteria for new features](#criteria-for-new-features) below.
* When in doubt about the acceptance of a change, you are welcome to ask via an issue first.

### Criteria for new features

1. New features should not detract from the default Chromium experience, unless it falls under the project's main objectives (i.e. removing Google integration and enhancing privacy).

    * For larger features, please propose them via an issue first.

2. New features should live behind a setting that is **off by default**.

    * Settings are usually added via a command-line flag and `chrome://flags` enties. See [the relevant section in docs/developing.md](docs/developing.md#adding-command-line-flags-and-chromeflags-options) for more information.
    * Unless there are significant benefits, adding the setting to `chrome://settings` is *not recommended* due to the additional maintenance required (caused by the infrastructure that backs preferences).

**NOTE**: In the event that the codebase changes significantly for a non-essential patch (i.e. a patch that does not contribute to the main objectives of ungoogled-chromium), it will be removed until someone updates it.
